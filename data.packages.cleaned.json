    "descriptions": "The Marangu Route has been referred to as the ‘Coca Cola’ route and this has led potential climbers to think\nthat it is an easy route to the summit. This is far from the truth to be honest! The fact that it requires a\nminimum of 5 - 7 days to complete, does not mean that it is easier than any other route. It is one of the\nshortest routes, but less than 5 days is not recommended (previous climbing and altitude experience\nrecommended). It is a popular route, so can be busy in peak season - requiring advance booking of hut\naccommodation to avoid any inconveniences. Also popular during the rainy season.\nIt is the only route where you sleep in huts, rather than tents. An optional acclimatization day at Horombo\nHuts is highly recommended for those with no prior trekking in altitude experience under their belt.\nThe Marangu Route begins from the Kilimanjaro Park Headquarters in the village of Marangu. The trail starts\nat 1,800m above sea level in the rain forest and heads westwards towards Kibo. As the altitude increases the\ntrail goes from the lush rainforest, through heath and moorland to alpine desert and ultimately the arctic\nzone at the peak. Ascent of Mt Kilimanjaro’s Crater Rim is at Gilman’s Point (5700m) and although it is only\n200m lower than Uhuru Peak - the final ascent can take another hour. The Marangu Route follows the same\ntrail down to Marangu Gate.",
