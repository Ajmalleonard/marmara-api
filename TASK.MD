## API Endpoints Structure

### Flight Search

- `GET /api/flights/search` - Search flights
- `GET /api/flights/inspiration` - Flight inspiration
- `GET /api/flights/price-analysis` - Price analysis

### Booking Management

- `POST /api/bookings/flights` - Create flight booking
- `GET /api/bookings/flights/:id` - Get booking details
- `PUT /api/bookings/flights/:id` - Modify booking
- `DELETE /api/bookings/flights/:id` - Cancel booking

### GraphQL Queries & Mutations

```graphql
type Query {
  searchFlights(input: FlightSearchInput!): FlightSearchResponse!
  getBooking(id: String!): FlightBooking
  getBookingHistory(userId: String!): [FlightBooking!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createFlightBooking(input: CreateBookingInput!): FlightBooking!
  cancelFlightBooking(id: String!): Boolean!
  modifyFlightBooking(id: String!, input: ModifyBookingInput!): FlightBooking!
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and request queuing
- **Payment Failures**: Add retry logic and fallback options
- **Data Consistency**: Use database transactions
- **Third-party Downtime**: Implement circuit breakers

### Business Risks

- **Booking Failures**: Add comprehensive error handling
- **Price Changes**: Implement price lock mechanisms
- **Refund Issues**: Create automated refund processing
- **Customer Support**: Build admin tools for issue resolution

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve** this implementation plan
2. **Set up development environment** with required dependencies
3. **Begin Phase 1** with database schema design
4. **Establish testing framework** early in development
5. **Create monitoring and logging** infrastructure
